Assignment 2- CSCE 625:

Here you can find my initial representation of the assembly puzzle problem for assignment 2. Please note that:
- I haven't included the turning feature of the pieces yet.
- I haven't considered the given location of the holes yet.
The algorithm evaluates any possible configuration of the pieces on a 7*7 board using the DFS method, and returns a solution if all pieces are placed on the board and there's only one blank cell on the board. Although the program does not lead to a solution yet because of ignoring the turning feature, the representation may be a good starting point for those who are still struggling with how to represent the pieces and placing them on the boards.
